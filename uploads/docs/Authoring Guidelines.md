# ($) Task Requirements

### ($) Ensure clarity and completeness
Describe all aspects of the task in detail, including what will be tested. Avoid ambiguity and leave no room for misinterpretation. Clearly define input and output â€“ specify the exact format of inputs and expected outputs. Include constraints such as data ranges, edge cases, and expected behavior in various scenarios.

### ($) Add unique value to the platform
Each new task should contribute something meaningful, whether it's introducing a new concept, reinforcing an important skill, or providing an interesting challenge. Avoid redundancy by checking existing tasks.

### ($) Align with platform standards
Follow the official authoring guidelines to ensure consistency in difficulty grading, structure, and format across all tasks. The task should be intuitive and well-organized.

# ($) Task Structure

### ($) Each task should include:

1. **($) Title**  
   A concise and descriptive name that reflects the core concept of the task. It should be engaging but also informative enough to give users an idea of what to expect.

2. **($) Description**  
   A well-structured explanation of the problem, outlining its purpose, constraints, and expected behavior. It should explicitly define the input format, output format, and any special conditions or edge cases. The description should be clear enough that users understand the task requirements without needing additional clarification.

3. **($) Initial Code**  
   A starting template that helps users understand the task structure.

4. **($) Solution Code**  
   A fully functional reference solution that correctly solves the problem according to the given constraints. This solution is used for validation purposes and ensures that the task can be completed as intended. The code should be efficient, well-structured, and follow best practices for readability.

5. **($) Unit Tests**  
   A set of test cases that thoroughly verify the correctness of submitted solutions. These should cover a variety of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and potential pitfalls. Tests should be designed to prevent hardcoded solutions and encourage genuine problem-solving.

# ($) Task Maintenance

As the author, you are responsible for maintaining your tasks. As long as you remain an active user of the platform, you should monitor and address feedback from other users. If issues are reported, such as unclear descriptions, missing edge cases, or incorrect test cases, you should fix them promptly to ensure a high-quality experience for all users. Regularly review and update your tasks if better solutions, optimizations, or improvements become available.

# ($) Before Publishing

After creating a task, it is sent to a **verified user** for review to ensure clarity, correctness, and overall quality. Only after verification will the task be visible for other users. The task is also automatically tested using the provided unit tests and solution code to confirm that it is solvable. Before submission, ensure that the task is fully complete, including a well-structured description, correct test cases, and a functional reference solution. Seek feedback from other users or friends to identify any potential issues before final publication.
