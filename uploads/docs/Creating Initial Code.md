## ($) Requirements

- The initial code should adhere to our coding guidelines for all languages.
- Both the initial code and the solution code should follow our stated naming conventions for every programming language.
- Remember that the user will see the initial code. It should not contain any hints that would give away the solution to the problem.
- Do not hide useful information. The initial code serves as a template for the user to better understand the task at hand. If you think certain details would help the user, include them without revealing the solution.
- Ensure that all required imports are included.
