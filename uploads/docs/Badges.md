# ($) Badge System Overview

In our platform, badges are used to recognize and reward users for various achievements, contributions, and milestones. Badges serve as an incentive to encourage engagement, improvement, and involvement within the system.

The **badge system** is designed to motivate users to participate actively, whether by validating tasks, mentoring other users, or contributing to the platform’s growth. Each badge represents a different form of achievement or contribution, and they can be awarded based on specific criteria set by the platform.

### Who Can Assign Badges?

Only **admins** and **teachers** have the permissions to assign badges to users, particularly **students**. This control ensures that badges are awarded fairly and based on actual performance and contributions.

- **Admins** have full access to the badge assignment functionality and can assign badges to any user based on their behavior and contributions within the system.
- **Teachers** can award badges based on student performance in tasks, assessments, and other related activities.

Students cannot assign badges to themselves or other students. The purpose of this is to maintain the integrity of the badge system and ensure that badges are earned through verified actions.

Now, let’s take a look at some of the badges that can be awarded:
